# Pewlett-Hackard

Create entity relationship diagrams, perform data modeling, and complete analysis on an employee database using SQL techniques.

Project Summary
The Humans Resources (HR) Department at Pewlett Hackard is preparing for several employee retirements, but they were unsure how many or which departments they work. 

All of these current retire-eligible employees have held different positions at Pewlett Hackard. This could be a good opportunity for HR to investigate why there were so few managers.


In light of these upcoming retirements, HR is also considering a mentorship program and wanted to get a better idea of which employees would be good candidates for mentoring. A quick query helped inform HR who are eligible to be mentors according to their criteria. The table provides a list of these employees and shows how long they have between with Pewlett Hackard as well as their positions in the company.
